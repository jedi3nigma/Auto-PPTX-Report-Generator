# Auto Powerpoint Report Generator

A proof of concept that uses Python code to autommatically generate a Powerpoint report based on data provided.  Note that this program is fixed to create defined charts and Powerpoint slides based on hard written code - running this on a dataset and files different than ones provided in this repo will **not** work.

To run this program:

1. Clone repository to your local.
2. Create and activate virtual environment.  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install package dependencies.  You may skip this if you already have required package versions of required libraries.
3. Open terminal and run `python main.py`.
